### 🔹 Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing

**Explanation:**
- The baseline linear model increases the parking price directly with occupancy ratio at each window.
- Prices rise steeply during periods of rapid occupancy growth, which can lead to sudden spikes — like the sharp price jumps seen in early December.
- This model is simple and responsive but lacks smoothing mechanisms, resulting in potential price volatility.
- It demonstrates that a purely linear relationship can overreact when occupancy swings occur, causing prices to become erratic and possibly confusing or frustrating customers.

### 🔹 Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

**Explanation:**
- The demand-based model uses a composite demand function combining occupancy ratio, queue length, traffic congestion, special days, and vehicle type.
- This approach normalizes the demand signal and adjusts prices within a bounded range (0.5x to 2x the base price), ensuring smooth and explainable price transitions.
- Compared to Model 1, the pricing curve here is much more stable, avoiding erratic jumps while still reflecting genuine changes in demand.
- Even during times of increased occupancy or special events, the demand function’s design dampens extreme price spikes, which leads to a better user experience and more predictable revenue.

### 🔎 Key Insights

✅ **Baseline Model Strengths:**
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Reacts immediately to changes in occupancy.

❌ **Baseline Model Weaknesses:**
- Highly sensitive to short-term occupancy fluctuations.
- Lacks consideration of other demand factors (queue, traffic, events).

✅ **Demand-Based Model Strengths:**
- Incorporates multiple real-world signals into a holistic demand measure.
- Maintains prices in a stable, controlled band — avoiding extreme volatility.
- Produces pricing behavior that aligns with economic theory of supply-demand balance.

❌ **Demand-Based Model Weaknesses:**
- Slightly more complex to implement and tune feature weights.
- May require additional data engineering to preprocess features like traffic or event indicators.

### 📌 Conclusion

Including both models demonstrates a progression from a straightforward occupancy-driven approach (Model 1) to a richer, more robust demand-aware pricing system (Model 2). While the baseline provides a simple benchmark, the demand-based pricing offers smoother, more realistic pricing evolution suitable for dynamic urban parking environments.
